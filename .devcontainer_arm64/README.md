# WARNING: .devcontainer_arm64

If you want to build the docker on the Jetson Orin, you have to run the shell script  `build_and_run_arm64.sh`. 
This script takes into account the 64arm architecture of the Jetson Orin.
If you already builded the docker and want to start only the container, you can use `run_container_arm64.sh`.
